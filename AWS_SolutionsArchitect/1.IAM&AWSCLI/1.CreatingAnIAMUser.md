User Group Details

Group name: admin

Policy attached: AdministratorAccess

Click Next

Add the user to the group you just created.

Add tags if needed â€” e.g., Department: DevOps

Click Create User





Notes:



It's better to attach policies to the group, then add the user to that group.



Inline policies are directly attached to users and not inherited from a group.
